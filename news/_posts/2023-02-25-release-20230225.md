Today, we have a special occasion on our hands. We have been waiting for this moment for almost two years: a new stable OpenRA [Release 20230225]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) is out now!

It has been a long road to this release. It is filled both with large features, and many important smaller scale polish. For more details see the previous news posts [[one]({{ '/news/playtest-20221203/' | relative_url }}), [two]({{ '/news/playtest-20230110/' | relative_url }}), [three]({{ '/news/playtest-20221223/' | relative_url }}), [four]({{ '/news/playtest-20230218/' | relative_url }})] and, as always, in the [full changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog/).

However, there is more! There has been great progress made towards supporting remastered assets. Those who have been following us on [Discord](https://discord.openra.net) may already know, we have a multiplayer-compatible HD Tiberian Dawn release! In case you are interested and own a copy of the remasters, you can download it [here](https://github.com/pchote/TiberianDawnHD/releases), but do keep in mind that it is still work-in-progress and does not reflect the final product.

We hope youâ€™ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA! Good luck on the battlefield commanders, and have fun!
